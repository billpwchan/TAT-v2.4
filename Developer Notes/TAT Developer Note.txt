Developer's Notes on TAT:

1. Macro is also an object of Script. It is stored in Script database with idScript, but also in Macro database with script_idScript. The script_idScript1 are reference to smaller scripts that are used to compose a macro object.
2. In TableActionCreationController, the controllerScriptLine is not yet defined before calling this.addActioninVbox. Have to call that function before, or it will cause NullPointerException with no specification.
3. in TabTestCaseEditController.java, cannot use session.beginTransaction().commit() at anywhere inside the loop. Or it will cause transistentObjectException. Unknown cause.
4. In TabTestCaseEditController.java, if iterate through each ScriptHasbeenConfigured, it will save duplicated records to the database.
5. Please use build.xml to combine all .jar files into a single one.
